## 👩‍🔬 Cancer, Tumor, and Aneurysm Classification and Detection

<img align="left" width="250" height="180" src="https://i.imgur.com/RsmO2hP.gif?raw=true"></a>
This repository contains the implementation of VGG16 and RESNET50 models, techniques such as fine-tuning with layer freezing and unfreezing were applied. Regularization methods like L1 and L2, dropout, and early stopping were employed to prevent overfitting. Strategies such as data augmentation and one-hot encoding were integrated, and optimization was carried out using algorithms like Adam. 

Model evaluation involved the use of confusion matrix, offering a detailed insight into the performance of brain disease classification.

## 🕵🏻 Dataset Overview
<p color="blue">
This project focuses on developing a classification model to detect brain diseases, such as cancer, tumors, and aneurysms, from CT brain scans.
</p>

### 💉 Types of Brain Diseases in the Dataset

1. **Cancer**: CT scans showing manifestations of cancer in the brain.

2. **Tumor**: Detailed images capturing the presence of tumors in the brain.

3. **Aneurysm**: Scans highlighting cases of aneurysms in the brain.
